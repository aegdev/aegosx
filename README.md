## What is Aegeus?

Aegeus, pronounced 'Ay-Gus' means 'Protection' or 'Shield' in Greek. Aegeus is based on PIVX, which drew its inspiration from Dash, a project that has solved many of the problems in Bitcoin by speeding up transactions, offering solid privacy solutions, and boasts a decentralized governance and funding system.

___We decided not to go with a traditional crowdfund model___ and offer AEG on the open market.  There were 21,000,000 AEG initially minted in block 1.  Everything has been put up for sale on crypto-bridge, and anything not sold before July 1, 2018 will be burned.

## What is the goal of the project?

We believe there is an incredible need for increased and enhanced privacy with regard to data storage, access, and trust.  We're working towards a goal of making distributed storage not only easy to access, use and manage for the everyday person but also secure and easily shared with trusted parties.  Currently, user data is commercialized and shopped around and we're aiming to put the people's data back in the hands of the people by providing a better alternative to common tools provided by massive corporations such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.  Data breaches foster a valid fear and are a threat daily to the security and privacy of your information.  Eliminating these centralized services with a more distributed approach is not only ideal, but essential.
